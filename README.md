Tablet read relay status & start app & show camera or web url

# Customer:
Please can you check with Dennis if we can do this? I need a possibility to send an action URL or to open an rtsp stream of camera in Fullscreen browser if the relais would be closed by button or other devices.

Example customer has a school and has bell push button with a potential free contact. He wants to connect the contact of the button with the display and then see the person in front of the door on the camera image.

# Answer:
Yes, we can do. First we need design a HID USB relay connect with our industrial Tablet. Then we will design a app run on our tablet. The app will read the Relay status. You can set the action you want to do in the app. Our app will help you open URL or other apps.
